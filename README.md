# Market-Analysis-for-Online-Store
## Introduction
 This project comprehensively analyzes various aspects of Group A and Group B's e-commerce performance. We begin by examining cumulative revenue and average order size trends for both groups, drawing valuable insights and formulating hypotheses based on the data. Additionally, we explore the relative differences in cumulative order size, conversion rates, and user order behaviour, all while identifying anomalies in user behaviour and order prices. The project delves deeper into statistical significance testing, first using raw data and then filtered data, to evaluate differences in conversion rates and average order sizes between the two groups. Through these multifaceted analyses, we aim to better understand e-commerce dynamics, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. conclusions and hypotheses.

## Datasets

Hypotheses — brief descriptions of the hypotheses

-Reach — user reach, on a scale of one to ten

-Impact — impact on users, on a scale of one to ten

-Confidence — confidence in the hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten

-Effort — the resources required to test a hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten. The higher the Effort value, the more resource-intensive the test.

Orders — brief descriptions of the orders

-transactionId — order identifier

-visitorId — identifier of the user who placed the order

-date — of the order

-revenue — from the order

-group — the A/B test group that the user belongs to

## Conclusion and further improvement
Conclusion:
The analysis reveals that Group B outperforms Group A in terms of conversion rate, demonstrating statistical significance. The data suggests that continuing the test is unnecessary, as Group B consistently excels in both conversion rate and average order size.

Improvement Area:
To further enhance the test's effectiveness, consider exploring strategies to optimize average order size for both groups.
